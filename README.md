# supply-chain
## What is the last mile distribution in supply chain management?
- In supply chain management, the last mile describes the difficult last part of the transportation of packages from hubs to their final destinations. Some of the problems of last-mile delivery include minimizing cost, ensuring transparency, increasing efficiency, and improving infrastructure.
- Order Placement -> Inventory Check -> Order Packing -> Route Optimization -> Dispatch and Delivery -> Delivery Confirmation
## Functional Requirements
## Functional requirements define what the system should do. They specify the behavior of the system and the functions it must support.

1. Order Management
- Order Placement: Allow customers to place orders through various channels (web, mobile app).
- Order Validation: Verify order details (e.g., availability, payment) before confirmation.
- Order Tracking: Provide real-time tracking of order status for customers.
- Order History: Maintain and display order history for customers and administrators.
- Order Cancellation: Enable customers to cancel orders within specified time limits.
2. Inventory Management
- Stock Monitoring: Track inventory levels in real-time.
- Reordering: Automatically generate reorder requests when stock levels fall below thresholds.
- Stock Adjustment: Allow manual adjustments of stock levels and reasons for changes.
- Inventory Reports: Generate reports on stock levels, sales, and replenishment needs.
3. Delivery Management
- Route Optimization: Calculate and optimize delivery routes based on various parameters (traffic, distance).
- Delivery Scheduling: Schedule delivery times and assign delivery slots.
- Vehicle Tracking: Monitor the location and status of delivery vehicles in real-time.
- Delivery Confirmation: Obtain confirmation from customers upon delivery (e.g., signatures, photos).
4. Customer Interaction
- Customer Registration/Login: Allow customers to create accounts and log in securely.
- Feedback Collection: Collect and process customer feedback and ratings.
- Customer Support: Provide support channels for addressing customer issues and inquiries.
5. Payment Processing
- Secure Transactions: Process payments securely via various methods (credit card, PayPal).
- Refund Handling: Process refunds for returned or cancelled orders.
- Payment Confirmation: Send confirmation of successful transactions to customers.
6. Reporting and Analytics
- Performance Metrics: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as delivery times, accuracy, and customer satisfaction.
- Operational Reports: Generate reports on inventory, delivery performance, and financial metrics.
- Data Analysis: Analyze data to identify trends and areas for improvement.
## Non-Functional Requirements
- Non-functional requirements define how the system performs its functions and are related to the quality attributes of the system.

1. Performance
- Response Time: The system should respond to user actions (e.g., order placement, tracking requests) within specified time limits.
- Throughput: The system should handle a certain number of transactions or requests per second without degradation.
2. Reliability
- Availability: The system should be available and operational 24/7, with minimal downtime.
- Fault Tolerance: The system should handle errors gracefully and recover from failures with minimal impact.
3. Scalability
- Load Handling: The system should scale to handle increasing numbers of users, orders, and transactions.
- Resource Management: Efficiently manage resources (e.g., servers, databases) to accommodate growth.
4. Security
- Data Protection: Ensure the protection of sensitive customer and transaction data through encryption and secure storage.
- Access Control: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive functionalities and data.
- Compliance: Adhere to relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
5. Usability
- User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate for customers and administrators.
- Accessibility: Ensure the system is accessible to users with disabilities, following relevant standards (e.g., WCAG).
6. Maintainability
- Code Quality: Write clean, maintainable code with proper documentation to facilitate future updates and fixes.
- Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation for system design, user guides, and maintenance procedures.
7. Integration
- System Interoperability: Ensure seamless integration with external systems (e.g., payment gateways, third-party services) and internal systems (e.g., OMS, TMS).
- Data Synchronization: Maintain consistency of data across integrated systems.
8. Backup and Recovery
- Data Backup: Implement regular data backups to prevent data loss.
- Disaster Recovery: Develop and test a disaster recovery plan to restore operations in case of catastrophic failures.
